Tobias made simulation of launch, but had problems with thrust. Rocket either fell into planet or uses more fuel than what is loaded. What we should have done was change size of box and number of particles until we made it. What we did was make a 3-stage-rocket. We almost made it, but had some struggles with structuring stages. Then we realized the verification method is incompatible with 3-stage-rocket, so we have to go back to basis.
