In our current model we let the particles go out of every side of the box. When they do we flip the speed. We tally up the particles that left the box, and say that 1/24 (6*4) of them lef in the nozzle. we never change the velocities or positions, except the direction, so everything like temperature and pressure is constant. To find mass consumed we use the rocket equation, which requires dry mass, exhaust velocity and escape velocity. escape velocity we calculate by using our planet, mass comes from our mission, and exhaust velocity is the mean of the abs velocity in corresponding coordiant of particles that left the box. This method feels quite sketchy, but im not sure why. the formula for mass consumed given in part1 has 4 intakes, thrust, fuel consume pr sec, rocket mass and speed boost. I guess we can use these to calculate launch time, but ill look into that later.
