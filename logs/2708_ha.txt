Mostly spent the day trying to figure out how to determine particles that fly out of nozzle and how much momentum we gain. We could (and did as a simple check) define a area/or volume that represents nozzle, and particles in that volume have gone out. Then they are moved to the top of the box and given new velocity. This is a quite simple approax, and the physical interpretation is very close to what we "actually" do. The big drawback is that it is slow. We have to check every timestep wether every particle is in nozzle. We are already checking if theyre outside box, using np.where, but this does so for all sides at once. We could use this to take a subset of all particles outside box and say they went out of nozzle. This is valid becuase we are assuming uniform ditribution of preassure, and thus location of particles on box.

What I find most promising is using the definition of the pressure to derive a formula for particles that leave the box in a time interval given temperature, number of particles and sidelength of box, assuming cubic box. This would be a very efficient way to determine propulsion. We would still simulat the box in part 1, to make sure our formula is correct, and then we can use that throughout the project. Tobias has tried, and come up with two different formulas, both of which gave a different answer to the simulation.

I futhermore see that the code has to be significantly restructured. I've based the current one on GCP from fysmek. However, this project is not about simulating a gas, thats just a (small) part of it. That has to be done soon.
