We tried to find an efficient and reasonably accurate way to compute the momentum loss through the nozzle. We already had implemented a numerical method, using a short sylinder at the bottom of the chamber, and moving the particles from there to the top of the chamber, implying that they left the nozzle, and were replaced by new particles from the combustion chamber.
We got the idea to try to use the pressure related formulas to give an analytical answer to how many particles are hitting the wall in a given time, and use this to calculate the lost momentum. We derived some possible formulas, but when we calculated the resulting values they were many orders of magnitude off from the numerical ones.
