wrote a whole new class, based on multistagerocket from yesterday, and made som tweaks to Engine. They now work and we are able to launch, with Launch, though we dont know why. The performance is much better than our program yesterday, though they should be roughly the same. but hey, if it aint broke, dont fix it. And it works greatly. I had to really impede the rocket to not have a too high acceleration an reach escape velocity in less than two second! This is good I think, because if we are to add air resistance later we have a lot of room to realistically improve performance
